# ION Engine 1.0

## Introduction
[ION engine](https://github.com/Korsreven/ion) is a fast, lightweight and fully functional 2D game engine using OpenGL. The engine should be easy to use, also for developers with a limited experience with C++. No prior knowledge of OpenGL should be needed. The API reference for the latest version can be found online [here](https://korsreven.github.io/).

## Source Code
ION engine is written in modern C++ (with some GLSL) and consists of around 115K lines of code. The development has been done exlusively using Visual Studio on a Microsoft Windows PC. The source code itself is platform independent and should be portable (with some coding effort).

## Project Status
ION engine has been actively under development for a period of 5 years (2017 to 2022). Now that the engine is stable and feature complete, development will begin to slow down a bit while I start working on some games. The source code will be maintained from time to time, when new bugs are found or new features are needed. Tutorials and code examples will become available at a later date.

## Dependencies
One of the things I enjoy the most when writing code, is actually writing most of the code myself. But there is no rule without exception... ION engine is using four different third party libraries.
* FMOD v2.1.10 (https://www.fmod.com/)
* FreeImage v3.18.0 (https://freeimage.sourceforge.io/)
* FreeType v2.10.4 (https://www.freetype.org/)
* GLEW v2.1.0 (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
