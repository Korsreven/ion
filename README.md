# Ion Engine
A fast, lightweight and fully functional 2D game engine, with an easy to use API for developers. One of the main targets is to be able to easily develop indy games for the Steam platform.

## Source Code
The game engine is written entirely in C++17/20 on top of OpenGL. While the development is mainly done using Visual Studio on a Microsoft Windows PC, the source code itself should be portable and platform independent.

## Project History
The project started in November 2017, where the main motivational factor was to modernize a former game engine called Lunar Engine (not published). Lunar Engine was in development over a period of 10 years (2007-2017). Instead of rewriting the entire C++98 codebase, it was decided that the new engine should be written from scratch in C++17/20 using modern best practices.
